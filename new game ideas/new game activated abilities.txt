ACTIVATED ITEMS IDEA DUMP
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-basically these are stat-less tools to help shape your playstyle
-binded to Q or E or mouse click
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-obvious: potions
 -have potions for HP, MP and Heat restoration, in varying amounts
 -potions will all share one global cooldown
 -have recipes for combining potions
 -potions will be infinite like they are now

-obvious: portal key
 -teleport to mouse cursor, costs mana, whatever, duh, i'm a doctor too

-obvious: BKB
 -debuff immunity (fairy bell)



-should have a bunch of just activated attacks, ex. missile strike, shoot 2 homing missiles, 30 second cooldown...generic stuff like that

-----------------------------------------------------------------
-buncha weird ideas:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-Hero's Gambit
 -on use, lose half of your health.
 -gain a buff for 5(?) seconds that raises your damage output
 -once the buff runs out, you are healed for 80% of the damage you did

-land mines
 -short cooldown, uses large amount of mana/heat
 -place a land mine that enemy heroes can't see, if they walk over it it blows up and they take x damage

-Charm of Nix
 -On use, your HP goes to 1
 -all damage dealt to you for 3(?) seconds is converted to healing
 -(i know getting set to 1 HP sounds bad, but consider that nothing is targetted, and you can stand in front of allies and take hits.  It's not as simple as "don't target him")

-blood chalice style item
 -spend HP to regain mana
 -if an enemy hero dies nearby, HP is refunded

-Ground Pulser
 -Instantly stun all enemy heroes touching the ground near you for 1 second
 -long cooldown

-goop
 -short cooldown and mana costs
 -leave a trail of goop for 3(?) seconds that makes allies go faster and enemies go slower

-sand wraith ult
 -on use, shows location of all enemy heroes
 -use again within 4 seconds to teleport to one of them
 -low mana/heat cost if second use isn't activated, higher if it is...cooldown doesn't change

-Gate Key
 -on first use, place a portal where you are
 -for the next 20(?) seconds, reactivate to teleport back to the portal

-Generic Stealth Cloak
 -On use, go invisible for 8 seconds
 -First attack out of stealth applies a 0.5 second stun

-flux ult
 -on use, pull all enemy heroes towards you

-Pikachu's thunder jolt thing
 -shoot a beam of electricity that circles around the surface it was placed on for X seconds and does some amount of damage...maybe like slows or mini-stuns or something idk.  Could also add something like a red shell, stays on the surface and bumps enemies around

-Geyser Gem
 -on use, spout a large water geyser towards your mouse, that does light damage to enemy units in it and pushes all units in it far away

-Nimbus Jar
 -On use, applies a buff that allows you to jump infinitely for up to 10(?) seconds
 -buff is immediately cancelled if you take damage

-Polar Orb
 -Place an orb in front of you that pushes enemies away for 8(?) seconds
 -reactivate as many times as you want to spend more mana and switch polarity (pulls enemies in)

-A line of items that give immunity to one damage type, but increase the damage you take from the other damage types, for a couple of seconds
