NEW GAME ITEM ABILITIES IDEA DUMP

-to start, each attack type will have 3 categories
-each category will contain 2 full sets of weapons in each tier
-abilities in each set will be different to offer players who build the same weapon type to still have a different playstyle
-tier 0 will probably still be one choice for most weapon types (like how iron broadsword is the only T0 sword)
-magic will be an exception, with 3 main weapon types and a "misc" category with abilities that affect all magic weapons.  Each weapon type will only have one set of weapons.



ABILITY IDEAS

melee


swords (close range high base damage)

(speed/range focused)
-chance to double-hit
-fire projectiles
-attacks apply a stacking debuff that lowers defense/increases sword damage
-increased movespeed while swinging (costs heat?)



(damage/tank focused)
-bonus damage based on defense/HP
-swing speed cut in half, double damage
-lifesteal
-increased defense while swinging (or dodge chance) (costs heat?)
-DoT's, slows, stuns, etc.

spears (mid-range mobility with decent base damage)

(mobility)
-charge effect (maybe add a stun if you hit someone while charging)
-movement speed increases damage
-swing at the floor to bounce up
-killing an enemy hero gives +1 agility

(damage over time)
-mushroom trail-type effect
-various DoT's
-bonus damage based on number of debuffs on target
-debuff that increases damage of DoT effects

boomerangs (long-ranged mobility with low base damage)

(disabling/gap closing)
-slow and stun effects
-spend mana to teleport to your boomerang
-boomerangs fly farther/faster
-bonus damage based on difference b/w your movespeed and target's movespeed


(raw damage)
-boomerangs do increased damage on the way back
-throw 2 boomerangs at once
-DoT's
-lifesteal?
-inherent bonus damage

ranged


bows (slower projectiles, larger area of effect, low heat costs)

(velocity/ease of hitting)
-hold shift: 2x velocity/firing rate, 2x heat cost
-fire 2+ arrows at once
-bows use half as much heat, and take the other half out of mana
-opponents are magnetically dragged towards your arrows (reverse homing)

(Damage/DoT's)
-DoT's
-inherent damage increase
-arrows that hit the floor/wall leave an AoE poison cloud where they land
-increased penetration

guns (high range, high heat, high damage potential)

(lower heat cost/ease of hitting)
-increased number of bullets shot
-lowered heat cost
-increased shot range/firing rate
-bullets richocet off walls x times


(damage/disable)
-bullets pierce some amount of defense
-bullets have a mini-stun chance
-while standing still, fire faster/do more damage
-inherent damage increase


thrown (mid-range)

(ease of hitting/amount thrown)
-increase thrown range
-increase amount thrown
-increase size of thrown weapons
-hold shift to go invisible, at the cost of mana

(damage/disable/DoT's)
-high damage, low duration DoT's (like bleed)
-thrown weapons stick to enemies, slowing them for 2 seconds.  At the end of the slow, they deal damage equal to 1/2 their raw damage.  Only one can be stuck at a time.
-thrown weapons stick to walls/floor, damaging enemies who walk over them.
-inherent damage increase/generic poison DoT or something

magic

lasers (very fast, high damage, high mana cost, long range)
-hold shift to charge lasers, increasing mana cost and damage dealt
-missing with a laser will refund 50% mana
-lasers will cost half as much mana, and take the other half out of heat
-inherent damage increase

staves (slow moving, very large area of effect)
-all staves will add 1 extra projectile for staves, and...
-chance to slow
-additional penetration
-projectiles split into new ones after a while of being out

clouds (similar to vilethorn/nettle burst, leaves an AoE 'cloud' that does damage to everything in it)
-add various debuffs (slows, DoT's, everything...)
-adds a constant cloud around you that does minor damage and has all cloud abilities earned
-increase rate that the cloud hits people
-increase size of cloud

misc (various ranges/effects/damage/mana costs)
-reduced mana cost of spells
-increase damage/crit chance with spells
-spells add a DoT that deals x% of your max mana as damage over 3 seconds
-other generic magic weapon stuff, i'll figure things out
