STS/UA!
-------------------------------------
This is a comprehensive manual for an extensive PvP team arena style game that I have created using Terraria as a base.  The title is undecided, but I have historically been calling it "sts" (smash the spikes) or "ua" (ultimate adventure).  STS is a reference one of the old win conditions of the game, and ua is the name of my code repository.  Neither of these will likely be the name of the finished product!!

-------------------------------------
CHANGES FROM TERRARIA
-------------------------------------
For those who are familiar with Terraria, you will notice a large number of subtle changes to the game.  These vary greatly in size and impact.  This section will focus on features originally from Terraria that have been modified or removed, and not on new features separate from Terraria that have been added in.  New features are covered throughout the other sections, as well as in a few dedicated sections.  If you haven't played Terraria, this section isn't too important.

-------------------------------------
USER INTERFACE
-------------------------------------
-The Inventory size is reduced from 50 to 10.  Basically, you only have your hot bar.  You don't acquire a large amount of items while playing, so the 50 inventory slots are pointless.

-The "trash item" slot has been removed.  Items can no longer be trashed or dropped.  Holding shift and right-clicking on an item in your inventory quick-sells it, whether you are talking to an NPC or not.  If you right-click while holding an item on your mouse, you will equip it if it is armor or an accessory, or do nothing if it is anything else.  This is to prevent players from trading items, or trashing valuables by accident.

-Ammo slots have been removed, and the "dye" slots on your equipment have been repurposed to ammo slots.  This simply cleans up the UI a bit.  Note that right-clicking ammo will automatically place it in the new ammo slot.

-right-clicking on an NPC no longer brings up an interface, it simply opens up the shop that the NPC owns.  This is to simplify buying new items, so that players don't waste as much time clicking through interfaces when they could be progressing.


-------------------------------------
MONSTER DROPS/SHOPS/MONEY/ETC...
-------------------------------------
-Monsters no longer drop items.  When you kill an enemy or hero, your "gold" value is increased by an amount equal to the monster's value or the set value for killing an enemy hero.  Gold is not an item, it is simply a statistic that is bound to your hero.  You can view how much gold you currently have on the top-left.  This change makes money handling MUCH more straight forward, as dropping money all over the place creates lag, and other players might pick up your hard earned drops.  Players also receive gold slowly over time (50 gold/second), to help players who are falling behind, or to help players reach a money requirement that they are very close to. 

-All NPC shops have been greatly modified.  Each base has its own 6 shops.  The NPC's are named after what they sell, and are: Recipes, Melee Weapons, Magic Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Armor, Accessories.  There is also one shop, typically in the center of the map, called the "Secret Shop."  This shop sells high tier weapons and armor.  Shops list their price in Gold instead of copper, silver, etc...And the selling price for items has been INCREASED from 1/5 the original value to 1/2 the original value.  All item prefixes have been removed, and there is no reforging system.

-Consumable items are no longer consumed on use.  This means that if you buy a Shuriken, for instance, you can throw an infinite amount of Shurikens.  The same goes for Bullets, Arrows and potions.  All of these are permanent, reuseable items.  Note that potions still have a 60 second cooldown.

-Items can still be crafted, although the list of craftable items is limited to what you can buy in the Recipe shop.  In order to craft an item, you need the recipe, and every item that the recipe requires, which is shown in the tooltip for each recipe.  Items can be crafted anywhere, and do not require a crafting station.  Among the recipes, you will find some classic Terraria craftables (ex. cloud in a balloon).  Realize that this doesn't mean that you can craft any Terraria Item.  For instance, just because you can buy a warrior, ranger and sorcerer emblem does NOT mean that you can craft an avenger emblem.  You can ONLY craft items that have a recipe.


-------------------------------------
CHARACTER CREATION/WORLD INTERACTIONS
-------------------------------------
-Character creation has been streamlined to selecting a hero and a team.  Players can no longer pick hair style/hair color, clothes colors, gender, hardcore/softcore, name, etc.  Players will only choose which hero they want to play as, which determines how they look, and the team that they will be playing on (white or black).  There is also a "spectator team" which will allow you to join a game as a ghost and spectate a match between other players.  You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's in this mode.  Upon creating your character, your name will automatically be generated in the following format: "Lv 1 [Hero_Name] ([team initial])".   For example, creating a Soul Eater on the black team would create a character named: 
"Lv 1 Soul Eater (B)".  the level in your name will change dynamically as your level increases.

-Players spawn with NO ITEMS.  No pickaxe, no copper axe, no copper shortsword.  Players DO spawn with 10000 gold.  This is a comparable amount to 1 gold in vanilla Terraria, as 1 gold = 10000 copper.  This money can then be spent on some starting items from the shops.

-Players are very limited in how they can interact with the world.  This game is about PvP, not digging and exploration.  There is no access to any pickaxes, axes, hammers, or explosives within the scope of the game, so you cannot remove any blocks or wall backdrops.  Also, players are unable to cut away vines or grass growing on the map with swords or projectiles.  The world is basically impossible to modify in-game.  Additionally, when closing the world, it is no longer saved, so if any changes were to be made, they would not be permanent.

-Players no longer take falling damage.  This would be generally unhealthy for the competitive nature (don't laugh) of the game.

-Water and Lava have been repurposed as "wells" for the white and black team, respectively.  Water no longer modifies your movement, and lava no longer hurts you.  Instead, white team heroes are healed to full when standing in water, and are also relieved of all debuffs.  Black teams have the same effect when standing in Lava.  This provides players with a quick way to refresh themselves and get back to battle.  Mana is also restored inside of the well, and the shops are close enough for players to buy items while they heal.

-Ingame time is locked in to a specific time that produces a good amount of light.  There is just enough darkness to still show off the lightning effects from objects, but not enough to obstruct vision.  The "Moss" backdrop has been modified to allow light to pass through it, much like glass walls.

-Red and Green candycane blocks have been repurposed.  Red Candycane blocks will allow white team heroes to pass through them, and green ones will let black team heroes pass through them.  This forms a barrier between each team's well/shops and the outside world.  Note that Projectiles from either team will still interact with these blocks normally.

-------------------------------------
HERO STATS
-------------------------------------
Heroes have several separate statistics that determine their capabilities.  Here is a list of each of them and what they do.

HEALTH:
-how much damage a player can take before dying.
-health is regenerated slowly over time.  Your health regenerates faster the longer it has been since you were last attacked, faster the longer it has been since you attacked, and faster the longer it has been since you moved.

MANA:
-Used by magic weapons, a couple of activated items, and a couple of melee weapons.  If you have no mana, you cannot use these weapons.
-mana is regenerated quickly over time.  Your mana regenerates faster the longer it has been since you were last attacked, faster the longer it has been since you attacked, and faster the longer it has been since you moved.

HEAT:
-Used by ranged weapons.  Contrary to mana, heat starts at 0 and slowly goes up towards its maximum as you use ranged weapons.  If you are at or above your maximum heat, you will be "overheated", and unable to use any ranged weapons for 2 seconds before your heat will start rapidly dropping.  If you stop firing for 0.5 seconds while you aren't overheated, then your heat will also start dropping rapidly back to 0.

LEVEL:
-Determined by how much experience you have gained.  You slowly gain experience over time, and you gain large amounts of it whenever you kill an enemy hero or NPC.  You also get a small amount of experience whenever an allied hero kills an enemy unit.
-Your level increases your base maximum HP and Mana.  It also determines which tiers of weapons and armor that you can buy.  Note that accessories do not require a certain level to buy.

STRENGTH:
-increases melee damage by 1 for every 2 strength.
-increases max HP by 2 for every 1 strength.

INTELLIGENCE:
-increases magic damage by 1 for every 2 intelligence.
-increases max MP by 2 for every 1 intelligence.
-increases crit by 1% for every 8 intelligence.

AGILITY:
-increases ranged damage by 1 for every 2 agility.
-increases movement speed by 1% for every 1 agility.

Critical Hit Chance
-The chance that you will deal double damage with the weapon you are using.  All weapons have a base 4% chance to land a critical hit.  Other items can increase this chance, and some heros have the ability to increase their critical hit chance through various means.

Movement Speed
-Expressed as a percentage, this is how fast you move in comparison to the base movement speed (100%).  Movement speed is increased by agility.  Apart from Movement speed is the effect given by the hermes boots and items containing hermes boots.  These increase the base multiplier that your movement speed is applied to, potentially increasing your actual movement rate quite a bit.  All hermes boots items give the same increased base speed, aside from silent steppers, which is very slightly higher, and lightning boots, which is a decent amount higher.


-------------------------------------
HEROES
-------------------------------------
When you begin a game, you choose a hero to play as.  Heroes determine the type of weapons you are allowed to use.  They also come with several special built in abilities.  Contrary to popular team brawler games like League of Legends and DoTA 2, heroes in this game are designed more to be subtle tweaks on how you play through a game, as opposed to the overarching theme of your play style.  Your early and late game presence, attack style and more are much more heavily determined by the weapons you choose, and the armor and accessories that you build.  Building upon your hero's abilities is still an important concept, but a build designed for one magic hero will likely result in a similar play style on a different magic hero.  Heroes are categorized into melee, magic and ranged heroes, as well as special purpose heroes that are typically allowed to use any weapon type.  Special purpose heroes often have a playstyle radically different from other more generic heroes.  There is currently only one special purpose hero, but I have 2 others planned out.

MELEE HEROES
-The Juggernaut
-Soul Eater
-Dragoon
MAGIC HEROES
-Celestial Being
-Mech
-Aegis
RANGED HEROES
-Cloak
-Pyro
-Zelse
SPECIAL PURPOSE HEROES
-Marlboro


-------------------------------------
MELEE HEROES
-------------------------------------
Melee heroes are limited to melee weapons.  Due to the tendency of these weapons to be close ranged, melee heroes generally have abilities that increase their survivability.

THE JUGGERNAUT
base HP: 140
base MP: 000
max HP: 460
max MP: 080
-Has built in knockback immunity
-Based on his combined x and y velocity, The Juggernaut deals bonus damage and gains bonus defence
Tips:
-you have built in knockback immunity, giving you a surprisingly large early game advantage.  Grab a strong early game weapon (EX. ball O' Hurt, Blade of Grass) and try to snag some kills on staff/vilethorn users and boomerang users.
-The faster you can move, the more damage you can do.  Grab mobility items as a priority.  Tabi can offer a large burst of damage early on.

SOUL EATER
base HP: 160
base MP: 000
max HP: 500
max MP: 080
-Slowly degenerates health, instead of regenerating it.
-Deals more damage the lower his health gets
-Gains bonus defence the higher his health is
-upon killing an enemy NPC, Soul Eater is healed for 1/4 of its maximum health.    Killing enemy heroes heals Soul Eater for 1/2 of the hero's maximum health.
Tips:
-Soul Eater has the highest potential health in the game.  Due to this, he can make for a monstrous tank.  Grab a good farming weapon (Wooden Boomerang, Iron Broadsword) and focus on grabbing a lot of accessories and armor to build up your defences.
-If you are feeling risky, Soul Eater can also manage some powerful early game ganks.  When Low on Health, try to land a high-powered ranged shot on an injured enemy Hero.  This can give you a huge boost to your early game farm, and is best done with either of the tier 1 boomerangs, or a flail.  You need to be quick, as you are just as vulnerable as your target (if not more).

DRAGOON
base HP: 120
base MP: 000
max HP: 420
max MP: 080
-Has a slightly increased based jump height
-Critical hit chance with melee weapons is increased by Dragoon's bonus movement speed %
-When Dragoon lands a critical hit, he applies a bleed that does damage equal to 60% of the critical hit's damage BEFORE applying defence, over a few seconds.
Tips:
-Dragoon is different from the other strength heroes in that he is more focused around mobility and damage output than survivability.  However, due to his need to land a critical hit to reach his maximum damage potential, farming is still very important.  Your time to shine will often fall in the mid-game, when you have a few agility boosting items and a decent weapon.
-Be sure to pick up a panic necklace early on.  Note that the critical hit chance is determined by movement speed, not agility, so the panic necklace will give you a tremendous boost to critical hit chance when you are low on health.

-------------------------------------
MAGIC HEROES
-------------------------------------
Magic heroes are limited to magic weapons.  Due to this, they obviously have more base and maximum mana than any other hero.  Most magic weapons have a very nice range, allowing them to attack from afar, but early on, many magic heroes will be using the vilethorn, which has a very limited range.  If a player decides to pick up the nettle burst in tier 2, then they will retain a close ranged play style for a longer portion of the game.  Although magic heroes are generally fragile, item builds can turn them into something much more tanky, especially when getting the refreshing orb, which allows them to heal everytime they cast a spell.  Their base HP max always be low, but the amount of ways that they can quickly heal themselves can prove hard to cut through.

CELESTIAL BEING
Base HP: 120
base MP: 060
max HP: 380
max MP: 240
-has built in wings, allowing Celestial Being to jump slightly higher and hold jump to fall down slowly.
-Critical hit chance with magic weapons is increase by celestial being's maximum mana, by 1% for each 10 maximum mana.
-When Celestial Being lands a critical hit, he has a 25% chance to freeze the enemy hero for 1 second (frozen heroes can't move or attack)
Tips:
-Celestial Being wants to crit as often as possible, in order to increase the chances of landing a freeze.  If you manage to freeze an enemy hero, get aggressive.  Run up to them and force as much damage as you can before they can move again.  Hope for a second freeze so that you can finish them off.
-Multiple hit instances are very powerful on Celestial Being.  The nettle Burst is your best friend.  If you land a freeze and trap an enemy hero inside the nettle burst, they are as good as dead.  Magic Missiles can also be very effective, especially with multiple penetrations raising your chance to freeze.
-Obviously, maximize your mana for a higher crit rate.  mana increasing armor, high intelligence accessories, etc. are very helpful.  Jungle Armor also gives some crit chance inherently.

MECH
Base HP: 120
base MP: 060
max HP: 360
max MP: 260
-Has built in rocket boots, allowing Mech to fly for a short period of time.
-Based on Mech's remaining mana, he will fire a rocket towards the cursor whenever he casts a spell that requires mana.  Rocket fired is based on this chart.  Note that it checks your mana before casting the spell.
mana   |damage|cost|   effect
000-100|   0  |  0 |no rockets fired
100-149|  20  |  0 |slow travel time
150-199|  28  |  0 |regular travel time
200-249|  36  |  5 |faster travel time
250-299|  44  | 10 |+an additional rocket is shot every 0.25 seconds
300-349|  52  | 15 |+rocket explosion is larger
350-399|  60  | 20 |+2 second slow
 400   |  70  | 30 |+1 second stun
Tips:
-Mech's rocket boots allow him to very easily avoid enemy heroes early on.  Due to this, he can be a very sustainable early game farmer.  Going the staff route can make for a devastating late game with mech.
-For an Early game play style, try grabbing a space gun and landing the laser and rocket together for a huge burst of damage.  You can also use the nettle burst to attack at a close range, and make the rocket easier to land.
-If you reach 400 mana, try to wait and land that first rocket for the stun.  You can likely kill the person while they are stunned at this point.

AEGIS
Base HP: 140
base MP: 040
max HP: 420
max MP: 220
-Aegis absorbs 25% of damage dealt to allied heroes when he is above 25% HP.
-Upon casting a spell, Aegis generates a mana shield for 1/2 of the mana spent.  Mana shields can be as big as 1/2 of your maximum mana.  When you take damage, it the mana shield will absorb it.  If you have a larger mana shield than the damage you take, then the mana shield will absorb all but 1 damage, which you will take.
Tips:
-Aegis has an incredible tanking ability.  Combine your mana shield with spectre armor, Magic Cuffs and a refreshing orb and you are next to unstoppable in the late game.
-Aegis can utilize just about any magic weapon you want.  Since he is so tanky, the Nettle Burst works very well by keeping him in close combat.  The Laser Rifle also gives him a neat way to quickly charge up his mana shield.
-Beware damage over time effects, as these will go straight through your mana shield.  Heroes like Dragoon, Pyro and Marlboro are big threats, as well as the venom debuff.


-------------------------------------
RANGED HEROES
-------------------------------------
Ranged heroes are limited to ranged weapons.  Ranged weapons use heat, which controls how much you can fire your ranged weapons.  Due to this, ranged heroes often need to take careful aim when setting up kills on enemy heroes, as overheating can quickly ruin your plans.  Ranged heroes are generally frail, however due to the fact that they often stack agility for damage, they also move at alarmingly fast rates, allowing them to get a distance between themselves an enemy heroes and attack from afar.  The heat restriction also can damper a ranged hero's ability to farm, so they often turn to hero kills for their income.  Ranged heroes are highly effective at picking off enemy heroes at almost any point in the game.  A couple of shots from afar with a flintlock pistol at the start of the game can kill a jungler at low health, and a burst of minishark bullets in the late game can put to rest just about anyone.

CLOAK
Base HP: 120
Base MP: 000
max HP: 360
max MP: 080
-After not attacking for 3 seconds, cloak goes invisible and gains 10% bonus movesment speed
-Cloak's first attack out of stealth deals double damage, and has a 100% critical hit chance.
-Whenever Cloak lands a critical hit, he applies Darkness to the enemy hero, giving them a 1/4 chance to miss enemy heroes with all attacks.
Tips:
-Cloak is designed to gank heroes.  With the absurd damage spike in the early game, even a flintlock pistol can hit someone for damage in the 40s.  Assert your dominance early on.  Follow around enemy heroes until they're low, and go in for the kill.  If you get a large early lead and upgrade to a musket quickly, you might be able to land a few one hit KO's.
-Although players can't see you, NPC's can.  Jungle NPC's will still chase you, and the tower will still shoot at you.  This could easily give away your position if you aren't careful.
-A musket is an obvious choice, as the early game damage is just ridiculous.  However, if you're uncomfortable with your aiming abilities, or want a decent farming weapon too, a bow and arrow can have a similar effect.  The damage won't be as high, but it still might be enough to kill the enemy hero, and landing consecutive hits won't be as difficult.

PYRO
Base HP: 120
Base MP: 000
max HP: 360
max MP: 080
-has built in wings, allowing Pyro to jump slightly higher and hold jump to fall down slowly.
-Pyro's attacks have a 1/2 chance to inflict on fire (damage over time, lowered defence), and a 1/2 chance to inflict cursed flame (high damage over time, large defence reduction).
-Pyro deals bonus damage based on his agility to units that are on fire and on cursed flame (these abilities do stack on units affected by both)
Tips:
-Pyro's early game damage potential is likely one of the highest in the game.  If you're especially aggressive, open up with Shurikens.  The combination of 3 separate damage over time effects will melt most low level heroes.  Otherwise, a Flintlock Pistol is usually a solid choice, as the fire effects will bring its damage up to a killable level.
-Early game kills will lead to your late game dominance.  Pyro is strong at every portion of the game, as long as he gets good farm.  Stacking agility and grabbing a rapid fire gun leads to an absurd amount of damage late game.

ZELSE
Base HP: 120
Base MP: 020
max HP: 360
max MP: 100
-Press Q to teleport to your cursor at the cost of 20 mana (10 second cooldown)
-Zelse has a mana burn effect.  When he hits an enemy hero, he does bonus damage based on a percentage of their maximum mana.  That bonus damage is also subtracted from their current mana supply.  The percentage that he burns is equal to his level (ex. level 5 = 5%)
Tips:
-Zelse is the ultimate counter to Magic heroes.  He is one of the few heroes that can shut down a late game Aegis.  A fully geared Zelse firing a minishark at a max level magic hero is likely the highest damage per second possible in the game.  If you know someone on the other team is going to play a magic hero, consider Zelse.
-Realize that Zelse generally has nothing special going for him in the early game.  He can however, almost always get away from enemy heroes.  If someone approaches you and you're not ready, just teleport away.  Then you can Run to the well, heal up, buy some items, and teleport back and keep farming.  His farming sustainability is on par, if not better than Mech's rocket boots.  You really do have a limited damage potential early on, as 1-3% of a level 1-3 magic hero even isn't very much.  You are generally doing the base damage on your ranged weapons in the early stages of the game, while Pyro and Cloak have abilities that add damage from the start.  However, just bear in mind that your late game potential can far exceed both of these heroes, especially against magic heroes.
-Guns are your best bet for Zelse, as you want multiple instances of damage to maximize the mana burn, and nothing is better for that than rapid-fire guns.  An early Uzi on a low-mid level magic hero is deadly.

-------------------------------------
SPECIAL PURPOSE HEROES
-------------------------------------
These heroes can typically use any type of weapon.  They often are built around some special gimmick that drastically changes their purpose.  There is currently only one Special Purpose Hero, but I plan to add many more.

MARLBORO
Base HP: 120
Base MP: 020
max HP: 420
max MP: 200
-Marlboro inherently does 80% less damage with all attacks
-Whenever Marlboro hits an enemy unit, he applies a random debuff to the enemy unit.  NPC's only get damage over time effects, but heroes can get any range of immobilizing, slowing, confusing, and more.
-Critical hits on enemy heroes will take away all damage over time effects from the dice roll on which debuff you get, giving you more immobilizing effects.
-Critical hits on NPC's will ensure the maximum possible debuff timer on that unit.
Tips:
-Marlboro is very different from other heroes.  The fact that he does 80% reduced damage means that almost everything you do to enemy units will do 1 damage.  Note that critical hits will still do 2 damage! Your damage output comes from damage over time effects, and you potentially have access to all of them.  The more they build up, the faster the target dies, especially early on.  In fact, despite the damage reduction, Marlboro is still one of the fastest early game farmers with a vilethorn. -Obviously, Marlboro excels greatly in the early game.  Since his damage potential is essentially the same throughout the game, all that changes about him is how easily he can hit you.  Grabbing a flinlock pistol early can help you bridge gaps, fire away until you land a freeze or slow effect.  Vilethorn can then come in for the kill, able to apply tons of debuffs very quickly at a close range.
-As Marlboro, your focus isn't as much on weapons, as it is on Accessories.  Marlboro can function well with vilethorn/nettle burst and a ranged gun all game.  What he really needs is survivability, and alternative damage sources.  Grabbing things like arcane cloud emblem, Chlorophyte Quiver and orichalcum armor can allow Marlboro to cover the map in debuff inducing projectiles.


-------------------------------------
ARMOR
-------------------------------------
Players have a helmet slot, a body slot, and a legs slot.
All armor sets have all 3 pieces, except for the wizard robes, which have no leg piece.

-------------------------------------
There is only Tier 0 armor designed for melee and magic heroes.  However, Ranged heroes often benefit from picking up Iron armor for some increased survivability.  Otherwise, Ranged heroes might look into some early accessories for stat boosts.

Iron armor (helm, top, bottom)

per piece: 2 defence, 1 strength

set bonus: 2 defence, 1 strength

Wizard Robes (Wizard Hat, Amethyst Robe)

per piece: 5 max mana, 2 intelligence

set bonus: +5% magic crit chance

-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
Tier 1 armor is very straightforward, as each hero type has one set of armor offered to them.

Shadow Armor

per piece: 4 strength, 3 agility, 7% attack speed
no set bonus

Jungle Armor

per piece: 10 max mana, 5 intelligence, 3% crit chance
set bonus: 3% crit chance

necro armor

per piece: 8 agility
set bonus: increased projectile velocity

-------------------------------------
T2
-------------------------------------
Tier 2 armor has two main categories for each hero type: an armor set with very powerful individual bonuses and no set bonus, and an armor set with moderate individual bonuses and a set bonus of some sort.  Varying heroes and play styles may prefer different armor set choices.

Cobalt Armor

per piece: 8 strength, 6 agility
no set bonus

Palladium Armor

per piece: 6 strength, 10% attack speed
set bonus: bonus life regen upon hitting an enemy

Mythril Armor

per piece: 15 max mana, 8 intelligence
no set bonus

Orichalcum Armor

per piece: 10% reduced casting cost, 5 intelligence
set bonus: fire a flower petal upon hitting an enemy


Adamantite Armor

per piece: 11 agility, more defence
no set bonus

Titanium Armor

per piece: 8 agility, 5% ranged crit chance
set bonus: after hitting an enemy, automatically dodge the next attack that would hit you in the next 20 seconds (20 sec cooldown)

-------------------------------------
T3
-------------------------------------
Tier 3 armor sets vary greatly in use.  Some of them have incredibly potent individual bonuses, namely the hallowed armor and chlorophyte armor, while others have devastating set bonuses.  Some heroes greatly benefit from these set bonuses, while other heroes prefer to stick with tier 2 armor.  For instance, Dragoon might prefer to stick with Cobalt armor, as it gives him bonus critical hit chance.

Turtle Armor

per piece: 12 strength, more defence
set bonus: deflect direct melee attacks for full damage

Crimson Armor

per piece: 9 strength, 15% attack speed
set bonus: 30% lifesteal

Hallowed Armor

per piece: 20 max mana, 13 intelligence
no set bonus

spectre armor

per piece: 9 intelligence, 2 bonus jump height
set bonus: 20% of magic damage dealt heals ally with the lowest HP

Chlorophyte Armor

per piece: 15 agility
no set bonus

Shroomite Armor

per piece: 9 agility, 5% ranged crit chance
set bonus: when not moving or attacking, slowly go invisible, raising ranged damage, crit chance and knockback



-------------------------------------
ACCESSORIES
-------------------------------------
Every hero has 5 accessory slots.  You cannot equip multiple accessories of the same type.  Accessories offer various bonuses to your stats.  The majority of them also offer some sort of additional ability, whether it is an extra form of mobility, or a defensive ability, or a boost to your offence.  Picking between Accessories is a very important part of your hero build process, and can make a large difference to your impact on the game.

----------------------------------------
premade pure stat accessories
----------------------------------------
These accessories simply increase your stats by a certain amount.  For each category, there is a low stat item, medium stat item and high stat item.  There is also a category of accessories that increase all of your stats evenly.  These items are often used in recipes for higher level accessories, and can also be very useful early on to gain an edge over other heroes.  Even something like an idol can give you a slight boost to your HP and damage output, allowing you to outlast a toe to toe battle with an enemy hero of a similar level.

premade ability accessories
-------------------------------------
These accessories offer some sort of enhancement to your hero.  They also normally provide a small boost to your stats as well.  Some of the more important items in this list are the mobility items.  A pair of hermes boots greatly increases your running speed, allowing you to escape, or catch up to enemy heroes that have yet to buy their own pair.  The same can be said about shiny red balloon or cloud in a bottle, giving you the ability to ascend faster than other heroes and better dodge attacks.  A cobalt shield is also often a staple item for every hero, especially melee heroes, as knockback immunity allows you to approach ranged heroes with much less trouble.

ACTIVATED ITEMS
-------------------------------------
Activated items are used through their hotkeys and offer various effects.  The main activated items are potions, which restore some amount of health or mana.  There are some more unique ones as well, however.  Activated items are NEVER consumed on use.

-------------------------------------
WEAPONS
-------------------------------------
Weapons are used by placing them on the hotbar and selecting them, then clicking.  There are 3 categories of weapons: melee, ranged and magic.  Within these categories there are subcategories...

melee:
-sword
-spear
-boomerang
-flail

magic:
-staves
-lasers
-missiles
-clouds
-thorns

ranged:
-guns
 -multi-shot
 -single-shot
 -rapid fire
 -bullets
-bows
 -single-shot
 -multi-shot
 -arrows
-miscellaneous

All weapons between T0 and T3 also have an item ability associated with them.  Every weapon's item ability is automatically built into the weapon itself.  If the player gains enough item experience with the weapon, then they can permanently learn the ability, and it will be applied to all weapons that it is applicable to.  Item experience is gained by dealing the killing blow to enemy NPC's or heroes while weilding the desired weapon.


-------------------------------------
MELEE WEAPONS
-------------------------------------
Melee weapons typically have a short range compared to ranged and magic, with the exception of boomerangs.  To counteract this, heroes built around melee weapons typically have higher survivability and potential mobility, giving them a chance to reach ranged and magic enemies before they are shot down.  Melee weapons are also the only weapons without any type of resource (magic weapons have mana, ranged weapons have heat), which means that you are free to attack nonstop.


-------------------------------------
SWORDS
-------------------------------------
Swords are generally the weapons with the lowest reach.  However, swords can output some dangerously high damage when hits start connecting.  Swords hit continuously and rapidly when at a close range, which can quickly cut down any opponent.  To slightly aid their short range, the beam sword offers an item ability which allows swords to fire a projectile every 2 seconds that deals damage equal to one sword swing.  These generally travel slowly and can be good for picking off an escaping hero, or adding an occasional extra hit at close range, but are usually too awkward to use for full on ranged combat.
-------------------------------------
T0
-------------------------------------
1.1.Iron Broadsword
-10 damage, very small
-ability: swords will continuously swing when you hold down the mouse

-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
T5
-------------------------------------

1.9.Chlorophyte Claymore
-40 damage, HUGE
-fires a green orb projectile (without beam sword ability)
-fires a fast traveling sword projectile (with beam sword ability)


-------------------------------------
SPEARS
-------------------------------------
Spears also have a relatively limited range, although they still reach farther than swords.  What spears excel in is mobility, and area of affect.  With the Dark Lance, players gain the ability to charge in any direction very quickly, allowing them to catch any enemy hero.  The Mushroom spear adds powerful teamfighting capabilities, with the ability to leave trails of mushrooms wherever you swing, effectively zoning out areas from enemy players.

T0
1.10.Trident
-11 damage, small
-ability: 20% attack speed bonus with spears

T1
1.11.The Rotted Fork
-19 damage, medium
-ability: 10% lifesteal with spears

T2
1.12.Dark Lance
-26 damage, medium
-ability: hold shift and attack with a spear to charge in the direction that you swing

T3
1.13.Mushroom Spear
-32 damage, large
-ability: when you attack, mushrooms will spawn along your spear.  These mushrooms float in place for 1 second, then disappear.  Enemy units take 1/3 of the spear's damage when they collide with the mushrooms.

T4
1.14.Gungnir
-37 damage, HUGE

T5
1.15.Chlorophyte Partisan
-41 damage, HUGE
-fires a spore cloud upon swinging


-------------------------------------
BOOMERANGS
-------------------------------------
Boomerangs are the ranged option for melee heroes.  To balance the fact that melee heroes are meant to be close ranged, boomerangs are generally a lot harder to use than other ranged weapons.  You can only have one boomerang out at a time, and they fly relatively slowly.  Upon hitting a target, the boomerang will immediately make its way back to you.  However, upon missing with a boomerang, the player will have to wait for the boomerang's full duration before firing it again.  This can create some very dangerous situations for the boomerang user.  Although boomerangs have a rough start, they have a very promising late game presence.  Upon getting the thorn chakram's ability, the player gains the ability to throw up to two boomerangs at once, lowering the impact of missing.  Also, the T4 and T5 boomerangs are some of the most threatening weapons in the game.
Boomerangs are a good choice for fulfilling a carry-type role.  If you can protect someone while they farm with a wooden boomerang, then they will become a serious threat later on.

-------------------------------------
T0
-------------------------------------

1.16.Wooden Boomerang
-10 damage, slow
-ability: 20% increased velocity with boomerangs

-------------------------------------
T1
-------------------------------------

1.17.Enchanted Boomerang
-18 damage, medium
-ability: 1/4 chance to inflict slow with boomerangs (50% movespeed)

1.18.Ice Boomerang
-19 damage, medium
-ability: 1/5 chance to inflict chilled with boomerangs (cannot jump)

-------------------------------------
T2
-------------------------------------

1.19.Flamarange
-25 damage, fast
-ability: 1/3 chance to inflict on fire with boomerangs (damage over time, lowered defence)

-------------------------------------
T3
-------------------------------------

1.20.Thorn Chakram
-31 damage, fast
-ability: user can have up to 2 boomerangs out at a time

1.21.Magic Dagger
-31 damage, fast
-on hit, teleports user to dagger (NOTE: COSTS 40 MANA)
-ability: boomerangs will travel back to user much faster

-------------------------------------
T4
-------------------------------------

1.21.Paladin's Hammer
-35 damage, extreme speed
-penetrates infinitely, flies back very quickly

-------------------------------------
T5
-------------------------------------

1.22.Possessed Hatchet
-40 damage, fast
-homes in on target, flies back very quickly


-------------------------------------
FLAILS
-------------------------------------
Flails are a unique mid-range option for melee heroes.  They fly about as far as some boomerangs, and their hit box is also much larget than most boomerangs.  However, they travel slower than boomerangs, and can be rather awkward to use.  The flails fire a ball attached to a chain, which is attached to the player, and among reaching the max length of the chain, the flail will fly back.  The player can then let go of the mouse, and let the flail fly back to the user and disappear, or hold down the mouse, and let the flail fling behind them.  The flail will stay out as long as you hold down the mouse, dragging along with you, which offers a couple of unique combat styles.   Flails also have one of the highest damage potentials in the game.  Their damage is all at once, though.  It is hard to repeatedly hit the same target with a flail at a fast rate, but even one hit from a flail will do a sizeable portion of damage.


T0:
1.23.Ball O' Hurt
-13 damage, short
ability: 5 bonus damage with flails

T1:
1.24.The Meatball
-22 damage, medium
ability: flails deal bonus damage equal to 5% of target's max HP

T2:
1.24.Blue Moon
-28 damage, medium
ability: flails pierce knockback immunity

T3:
1.25.Sunfury
-33 damage, long
ability: 1/3 chance to inflict burning with flails (heavy damage over time, lowered movement speed)

T4:
1.26.Dao of Pow
-37 damage, very long
-has a chance to confuse enemy units (left and right controls are swapped)

T5:
1.27.Flower Pow
-42 damage, extremely long
-while flower pow is out, it will fire flower petals at the nearest target, doing damage equal to 1/2 the flail's damage


-------------------------------------
MAGIC WEAPONS
-------------------------------------
Magic weapons are probably the category with the most variation between weapons.  In order to use a magic weapon, you need mana.  Each magic weapon costs a certain amount of mana, with the exception of the vile thorn and amethyst staff, both of which attack for free.  You will gain additional mana as you level up, and you can also get more mana from accessories and armor that give intelligence or bonus mana.


-------------------------------------
STAVES
-------------------------------------
Staves are the main late-game option for magic users.  The early staves are very hard to use, even for farming.  What staves do, is fire a projectile in the direction of your cursor.  On the early staves, these projectiles fly at a very slow rate, and they don't really do very much damage either.  However, the projectiles fired by late game staves, such as the boulder staff or the shadowbeam staff, are insanely powerful.  The main item ability for early staves is increasing the number of projectiles fired at a time by staves, so if you get all 3 of these abilities, you have each staff firing 4 projectiles, effectively multiplying the power of already powerful late game weapons by 4.  Late game is almost always in the hands of the farming staff user.


(note that since all abilities are built in, amethyst staff, topaz staff and emerald staff will fire 2 bolts by default)

T0:
2.1.Amethyst Staff
-fires a purple bolt at a very slow rate
-costs 0 mana
-ability: staves fire an additional projectile

T1:
2.2.Topaz Staff
-fires an orange bolt at a slow rate
-costs x mana
-ability: staves fire an additional projectile

T2:
2.3.Emerald Staff
-fires a green bolt at a medium rate
-costs x mana
-ability: staves fire an additional projectile

T3:
2.4.Skull Staff
-fires large, slow moving skulls
-costs x mana
-ability: staff projectiles penetrate an additional time

T4:
2.5.Frost Staff
-fires an icy bolt at a fast rate
-costs x mana
-has a chance to inflict frostburn on enemies (damage over time, reduced movement speed)

2.6.Boulder Staff
-fires a large boulder.  Boulder is affected by gravity and bounces around for 4 seconds or until it hits something (2 things with skull staff ability)
-costs x mana

T5:
2.7.Shadowbeam Staff
-fires an incredibly fast moving purple beam that bounces off walls

-------------------------------------
LASERS
-------------------------------------
Lasers are magic weapons that fire a very fast traveling laser in the direction of the cursor.  Aside from the space gun, the travel time of the laser weapons are essentially instant.  With a good eye, these weapons can be very potent, as a well aimed laser isn't really dodgeable.  Lasers change greatly in play style once the laser rifle is obtained, which gives the player the ability to charge up the laser.  A fully charged laser shot will fire 3 lasers, while a mid-charged one with fire 2, and one with little to no charge fires 1.  In addition to this, charged lasers do increased damage, up to double damage at max charge.  A well aimed, fully charged laser shot is an incredibly reliable way to knock off a huge portion of an enemy hero's health.  Due to the nice range and low cost of the space gun, and the high damage potential of the laser rifle and heat ray, lasers can help a magic user be relevant all game.  Note that there are no laser weapon options in every other tier, so consider weapons you might like to get inbetween these tiers.  Vile thorn and nettle burst make good filler for tiers 0 and 2, or magic missile.  Tier 4 can often be skipped, as laser rifle should suffice until tier 5.

t0: no weapons available
t1: 
2.8.Space Gun
-Fires a green laser at a fast rate
-costs x mana
-ability: if a laser does not hit a target, user is refunded 50% of mana cost (includes mana cost from charging laser rifle ability)

t2: no weapons available
t3:
2.9.laser Tifle
-fires a purple laser at a very fast rate
-costs x mana
-ability: hold down mouse to spend mana and charge up lasers, increasing damage output and number of lasers fired

t4: no weapons available
2.10.Heat Ray
-fires an orange laser at instant speed
-costs x mana
-when charging a heat ray with laser rifle ability, the length of the laser is increased as well as damage and number of lasers

-------------------------------------
MISSILES
-------------------------------------
Missiles fire a small projectile towards the cursor.  As long as the player holds down their mouse, the projectile will continue to follow the cursor until it hits a wall or enemy unit.  If the player lets go of the mouse, the missile will fly in the last direction it was traveling.  The ability to guide the missile through obstacles and enemies to hit a specific hero can be very useful, especially when done from a far away distance.  The base damage output of these weapons is often slightly higher than other weapons in their tier, allowing missile users for very controllable, very focused, high damage on single targets.  Note that missile weapons are not available until tier 2, so they are strictly a mid-late game weapon choice.  Consider some other low level spells, such as vile thorn in tier 0, and space gun/crimson cloud in tier 1.

T0: no weapons available
T1: no weapons available

T2:
2.11.Magic Missile
-launches a small blue missile to the cursor
-costs x mana
-ability: missiles penetrate an additional time before disappearing

T3:
2.12.Flame Missile
-launches a mid-sized flaming missile to the cursor
-has a chance to inflict on fire (damage over time, lowered defence)
-costs x mana
-ability: missiles penetrate an additional time before disappearing

T4:
2.13.Rainbow Missile
-launches a mid-sized rainbow missile to the cursor
-costs x mana
-As long as the player is holding down the mouse, the rainbow missile leaves behind a trail of music notes, which do damage equal to the missile itself, and linger for a half second before disappearing.

T5:
2.14.Inferno Missile
-Launches a large flaming missile to the cursor
-has a chance to inflict on fire (damage over time, lowered defence)
-costs x mana
-upon hitting a wall or using up its penetration, the missile will explode, leaving a lingering explosion for several seconds that will repeatedly hit anything inside of it for damage equal to the missile itself.


-------------------------------------
CLOUDS
-------------------------------------
Clouds are magic weapons that fire a cloud to the position of the cursor.  Once the cloud reaches the cursor or hits a wall, it will stop there, and begin raining down on things below it.  The rain damages enemy units.  The rain cloud will remain in place for a very long time on its own, but it can be broken by enemy heroes if it is hit twice by projectiles.  Note that there are only two cloud weapons available; These are meant to be secondary weapons, and not your main form of damage.  It is a good strategy to leave clouds in pivotal spots on the map, to zone out your opponents, or cause them to waste time breaking the clouds.

T0: no weapons available

T1:
2.15.Crimson Rod
-fires a red cloud to the cursor, which rains blood on enemies.
-costs x mana
-maximum of 1 per player on the map, casting the spell while a blood cloud is already out will destroy the old cloud.
-ability: 5% lifesteal on all spells

T2: no weapons available

T3:
2.16.Numbus Rod
-fires a white cloud to the cursor, which rains on enemies.
-costs x mana
-maximum of 2 per player on the map, casting the spell while 2 clouds are out will destroy the oldest cloud.
-ability: 5% lifesteal on all spells (stacks with crimson rod ability)

T4: no weapons available
T5: no weapons available


-------------------------------------
THORNS
-------------------------------------
Thorns leave an area of affect in the direction of the cursor, which will continuously damage enemies within it.  The thorn category is home to the vilethorn, the most common starting weapon for magic users.  It costs 0 mana, and hits continuously, making it very good for early game farming, as NPC's can be very predictable and easy to hit.  The low damage output and the fact that most heroes aren't immune to knockback in the early game makes the vile thorn generally bad for attacking enemy heroes, but it does do a good job of pushing them away, or pushing them into your tower.  The nettle burst is an upgraded version of the vilethorn, with more area of affect and more damage output.  If you get an enemy hero stuck in the center of this, it can quickly tear them apart.  Note that, much like the clouds, this category has only two weapons.  These weapons are also meant to fill gaps in other weapon categories.  As such, their item abilities are something that any magic user can take advantage of.

T0:
2.17.Vilethorn
-fires a short, green thorn cloud in the direction of the cursor.  Enemies within the cloud take continuous damage.
-costs 0 mana
-ability: all spells cost 10% less mana to cast

T1: no weapons available

T2: Nettle Burst
-Fires a long, brown nettle cloud in the direction of the cursor.  Enemies within the cloud take continuous damage.
-costs x mana
-ability: all spells cost 10% less mana to cast (stacks with vilethorn ability)

NOTE: There is also one other magic weapon in the game, but it doesn't fit into any category.  The massive Rainbow Gun, a Tier 5 magic weapon, fires a large rainbow in the direction of the cursor.  The rainbow will remain in place for a couple of seconds before disappearing.  Any enemies caught in the rainbow will take a high amount of continuous damage.  Due to this, it almost acts like a thorn weapon, although it doesn't exactly shoot thorns.

2.18.Rainbow Gun
-fires a rainbow in the direction of the cursor.  Enemies within the rainbow take continuous damage.
-costs x mana


-------------------------------------
RANGED WEAPONS
-------------------------------------
Ranged weapons are unique in that the majority of them use ammo, which is purchased separately from the weapon.  The ammo controls the projectile you fire, and often the base speed of the projectile, while the weapon determines how many projectiles you shoot, and at what rate they are shot.  To determine how much damage you will do with an ammo using weapon, you add together the damage of the weapon and the damage of the ammo.  As you use your ranged weapons, you will accumulate heat at a rate based on the weapon and ammo that you are weilding.  If you heat reaches or goes over its maximum, then you will be overheated, and unable to fire for 2 seconds, after which point your heat will start rapidly dropping back to 0.  If you stop firing while not overheated for over half of a second, your heat will also rapidly drop to 0.  This keeps ranged heroes from being able to hold down the mouse and rapid-fire spam bullets across the screen constantly, while still offering them a short burst-damage window.  It also greatly rewards players with good aim and careful positioning.



-------------------------------------
GUNS
-------------------------------------
Much like real life, guns fire small, accurate, high speed bullets.  Guns generally do slightly less damage than bows, but either fire much faster, or fire several bullets at once, usually putting their single target damage per second much higher than arrows.  Guns have a lot more options than bows, and give ranged heroes a slightly more late game carry play-style.  An early game flintlock pistol might hold off enemy heroes fairly well, but getting kills with it only really happens with lucky snipes on injured players.  On the other hand, getting a minishark in the late game with a couple of gun item abilities can allow you to mow down just about anyone with an absurd burst of damage.  Gun playstyles centralize around faness and careful positioning, as guns will eat up your heat much faster than any other ranged weapons will, giving you a much more limited stream of damage.  Missing a few bullets can easily cost you a kill.

-------------------------------------
SINGLE-SHOT GUNS
-------------------------------------
Single shot guns fire one bullet at a time.  They are no automatic, and you will have to click everytime you want to fire a bullet.  In this category is the starter gun, the flintlock pistol, and then two guns based around very high bursts of damage from single shots.  A nice feature of these guns is their low heat cost.  The musket and sniper rifle have such a slow rate of fire that you cannot overheat on these guns.

3.1.Flintlock Pistol
-Fires one bullet at a moderate speed and low damage
-medium reload time
-uses x heat

-------------------------------------
RAPID-FIRE GUNS
-------------------------------------
Rapid fire guns have one of the highest DPS potentials in the game.  Their base damage is usually low, but the rate at which they can hit a single target more than makes up for this.  Be careful though, as these are the guns that will easily make you overheat.  Rapid fire guns are a high skill cap weapon category, and are often the guns that you will end up using in the later tiers to maximize damage potential.

t2: 
3.4.Uzi
-Continuously fires bullets at a medium-fast rate for low damage
-uses x heat
-ability: 15% reduced heat cost on all guns

t3: 
3.5.Clockwork Assault Rifle
-Continuously fires bullets in a 3-shot round, at a very fast rate for moderate damage

t4: 
3.6.Minishark
-Continuously fires bullets at a fast rate for moderately high damage
-applies 2 seconds of "shark tooth" to enemy heroes each time it hits
-shark tooth is a stacking debuff, in that each time it is applied, the time is added to the duration of the debuff, instead of resetting the timer to the new time.  Shark tooth lowers the target's defence by 1/2 of the remaining duration of the debuff (ex. if the debuff had 10 seconds remaining, you would have -5 defence)

-------------------------------------
MULTI-SHOT GUNS
-------------------------------------
These guns fire multiple bullets at once.  They are especially good for farming and tower pushing, as the bullets will each hit NPC's separately.  However, only one bullet will hit enemy heroes, even if they all go through them.  Therefore, the main focus of these guns should usually be around farming, as their item abilities are very strong.  Even having one of their abilities can make a rapid-fire gun even more powerful.  In the late game, a high tier multi-shot gun can also push the tower at an alarming rate.

-------------------------------------
BOWS
-------------------------------------
Sporting a much larger, slower projectile, a much more straight forward progression line, a much lower heat cost, and generally higher damage per hit (aside from the musket and sniper rifle's monstrous damage), bows have a remarkably different playstyle compared to guns.  Due to the curvature that arrows are fired at, bows are more about area control and map coverage than careful aiming and positioning.  It's generally easy to dodge a single arrow slowly flying towards you, so bow users focus more on putting you in situations where you have to take a hit.
