HOW TO PLAY STS
disclaimer:
1. don't complain about not knowing what anything does, all dota style games suck the first few times you play them
2. if you're playing more than 2v2, realize that the map wasn't designed for this and it might be a bit of a clusterfuck
3. i've attached a massive manual that explains the majority of the game if you care to read through it, much like the game though the manual is also in development!!!


FOR PLAYERS
1. unrar trunk
2. navigate to trunk/bin/debug/terraria.exe
3. select multiplayer, create character, choose hero/team
4. obtain IP address from host's command line, leave port as 7777

FOR HOST
1. unrar trunk
2. place "sts1v1" map file in documents/my games/terraria/worlds
3. navigate to trunk/bin/debug/terrariaServer.exe
4. load "sts1v1" map in console window
5. skip all other options (press enter)
6. IP address for players will be displayed on console window

TO RESET GAME
1. all players: save and exit, create new character
2. host: close server (hit red X to avoid saving), reopen with same settings
