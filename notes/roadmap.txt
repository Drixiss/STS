(0.1.3) possibly think up a better exp per level formula

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------------------
-dark lance charge initial attack does not work with juggernaut's velocity damage
-homing items need to do the following:
 -not home in on: allies, invincible towers
 -give enemy heroes priority for homing
 -list of homing items:
  -flower pow
  -piranha gun
  -chlorophyte bullets
  -possessed hatchet
  -bees
  -chlorophyte set bonus
---------------------------------

NEW CONCEPTS
---------------------------------
-NEW HERO: TIKI (no set damage style)
 -gains pygmy warriors as he levels
 -level 1: 1 pygmy,   10 damage
 -level 3: 1 pygmy,   15 damage
 -level 4: 2 pygmies, 15 damage
 -level 5: 2 pygmies, 20 damage
 -level 7: 3 pygmies, 25 damage
 -level 9: 3 pygmies, 30 damage
 -level10: 4 pygmies, 30 damage
 -level11: 4 pygmies, 35 damage
---------------------------------

NEW RANGED SYSTEM: HEAT
---------------------------------
Ranged heroes gain max heat over time each level
using a ranged weapon adds an amount of heat
if heat reaches max heat, player cannot attack
heat goes down at constant rate fairly quickly overtime
