FIRST: copy 'STS1v1 1.3.wld' and paste it into the folder 'my documents/my games/STS/Worlds'  The folders likely don't exist, so just create them.  Make sure to capitalize STS and Worlds.

SINGLE PLAYER
1. navigate to bin/debug/ and run 'terraria.exe'
2. select single player, create a character, pick from the 11 heroes and click create.
3. select the 'STS1v1' world we moved earlier, and the game will start.  This is great for trying out new heroes and testing things.

MULTIPLAYER:

NOTE: it is good practice to get all of the clients connecting to the server first, then running the server.  This way, everyone will join at the exact same time, when the game starts.

Running the server:
1. navigate to bin/debug and run 'terrariaserver.exe'
2. follow the steps to run the 'STS1v1' map.  You should be able to just press enter through the other settings.  It might take a while to start the server.
3. Your IP will be shown on the console once the server is up.
NOTE: if you want to play wirelessly with friends, you will need to forward port 7777 on your router.  You can likely find a quick guide to do this by googling "port forwarding" and the name of your router.

Connecting to the server:
1. navigate to bin/debug and run 'terraria.exe'
2. select multiplayer, and join a server.  Create a character and choose the team that you will be playing on.
3. Select your freshly made character, then type in the IP address displayed on your server's console.  Leave the port as 7777.
4.  You should connect to the server automatically.
