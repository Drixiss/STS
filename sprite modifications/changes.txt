REGULAR CREEPS

minimum: just make them look more team oriented.  White/blue theme for npc 26, black/red theme for npc 27.  NPC 26 has a little hat and shirt, you could just change colors of these and use them for npc 26 and 27.

detailed: make them look more like a white knight and a black knight with armor on and stuff.  Maybe you could use some of the armor sprites for players and kinda paste them onto the creep sprites.

TOWERS

minimum: Use the same sprite that we used before: the destroyer head.  I've included that in case you want to use that.  Make the white tower a little lighter with a blue eye, and the black tower a darker gray, almost black, with a red eye.

detailed: I dunno maybe you can think of some sweet idea for towers, but the destroyer heads are fine for now

BIG CREEPS

minimum: don't do anything, they already look pretty team oriented

detailed: maybe replace both sprites with the paladin sprite, and recolor it to be black/red themed for the black team
